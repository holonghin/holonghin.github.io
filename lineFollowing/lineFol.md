# LINE FOLLOWING ROBOT

###### By Jonas Ho, Mike Ho

> Line following system is an automated robot that can move along a black line or a magnetic field path drawn on a contrasting color surface. The system typically consists of the sensors installed at the front end of the robot and the wheels driven by the motors. These sensors detect changes on the chosen path to adjust the direction of the wheels, keeping the robot on the line. The line following system is commonly used in industrial automation, logistics transportation, environmental monitoring, and other fields.
